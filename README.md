# Color-Switch-Game
This is a project for Advance Programming Course (Monsoon Semester 2020) by Manas Gupta and Prachi Goyal.

Created a JavaFX application for the game - Color Switch. The objective of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by manoeuvring the obstacles. If you hit any obstacle, you can continue with your earned stars or the game ends and you have to start from the beginning.
